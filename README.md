# ContactHub 📇

This project contains a sample ASP.NET Core app. This app is an example of the article I produced for the Telerik Blog (telerik.com/blogs).

Welcome to ContactHub, an ASP.NET Core 7 Minimal API application! 

🚀 This application is designed to help you learn SOLID principles while exploring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using an SQLite database.

## Features 🌟

✅ **Create, Read, Update, Delete:** Easily manage your contacts with full CRUD functionality.

📁 **SQLite Database:** Utilize the lightweight and efficient SQLite database for data storage.

📚 **Teaching SOLID Principles:** This application is a great resource to understand and practice SOLID principles in real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

📋 [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) installed.

## Getting Started 🚗

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zangassis/contact-hub.git
  
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ContactHub
   ```

3. Build and run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to `https://localhost:5001` to access ContactHub.

## Usage 💡

- **Create:** Add new contacts to your hub with relevant information.
- **Read:** Browse and view the details of your contacts.
- **Update:** Edit and update contact information as needed.
- **Delete:** Remove contacts that are no longer needed.

## SOLID Principles 🧱

This application is a valuable resource for learning SOLID principles:

- **S - Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class has a single responsibility.
- **O - Open/Closed Principle:** Code is open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L - Liskov Substitution Principle:** Derived classes can substitute their base classes.
- **I - Interface Segregation Principle:** Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.
- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
